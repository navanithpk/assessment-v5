**TASK**: Analyze the following question and select the MOST relevant learning objective(s) from the provided list.

**CONTEXT**:
- Subject: A Level
- Grade: Alternating currents
- Topic: Physics

**QUESTION**:


[Image Content]: A.uniform solid block is fully submerged in a tank of water.
The dimensions of the block are x and y, as shown

water surface

The block is held vertically in the position shown. The density of the block is the same as the
density of the water.

If the block is always held at the same depth d below the surface of the water, which single
change would increase the magnitude of the upthrust force on the block?

decrease the density of the block

B hold the block horizontally
increase dimension y
D increase the density of the block

**AVAILABLE LEARNING OBJECTIVES**:
1. [21.1.1] Describe sinusoidal variation of current and voltage

**TASK**: Analyze the following question and select the MOST relevant learning objective(s) from the provided list.

**CONTEXT**:
- Subject: A Level
- Grade: Alternating currents
- Topic: Physics

**QUESTION**:


[Image Content]: Which statement about energy is not correct?

A

B
c
D

Energy is never lost but it may be transferred between different forms.
In an inelastic collision, the total energy is constant.
The efficiency of a system is the ratio of the useful energy output to the total energy input.

When a machine does work, friction reduces the total energy

**AVAILABLE LEARNING OBJECTIVES**:
1. [21.1.1] Describe sinusoidal variation of current and voltage
2. [21.1.2] Recall and use rms and peak values relations

**INSTRUCTIONS**:
- Read the question carefully, including any image content
- You may select MULTIPLE learning objectives if the question covers multiple concepts
- Select objectives that the question is specifically assessing
- Respond with ONLY the numbers separated by commas (e.g., "1,3,5")
- Do NOT include explanations, just the numbers

**QUESTION**:


[Image Content]: A glass tube is closed at one end and has a loudspeaker at the other end.

c loudspeaker

A stationary wave is formed with a node at the closed end of the tube when the sound has
frequency fo. There are no other nodes.

glass tube

The frequency of the sound is then slowly increased
What is the frequency of the sound that produces the next stationary wave?

A 1.25f B 1.50f C 2.00% D 3.00%

**AVAILABLE LEARNING OBJECTIVES**:
1. [21.1.1] Describe sinusoidal variation of current and voltage
2. [21.1.2] Recall and use rms and peak values relations

One terminal of a galvanometer is connected to point X. The galvanometer reads zero when its
other terminal is connected to a point that is a distance of 60cm from one end of the
potentiometer wire.

One terminal of a second galvanometer is connected to point Y. This galvanometer reads zero
when its other terminal is connected to a point that is a distance of 80cm from the same end of
the potentiometer wire.

**TASK**: Analyze the following question and select the MOST relevant learning objective(s) from the provided list.

**CONTEXT**:
- Subject: A Level
- Grade: Alternating currents
- Topic: Physics

**QUESTION**:


[Image Content]: Light of wavelength 2 is incident normally on two narrow slits S; and S, a small distance apart
Bright and dark fringes are observed on a screen a long distance away from the slits

light,
wavelength

The nth dark fringe from the central bright fringe is observed at point P on the screen.
Which equation is correct for all positive values of n?

A S,P-S)P= a

B S,P-S;P=na

C SP-S\P=(n-4

D spss du

**AVAILABLE LEARNING OBJECTIVES**:
1. [21.1.1] Describe sinusoidal variation of current and voltage
2. [21.1.2] Recall and use rms and peak values relations

**INSTRUCTIONS**:
- Read the question carefully, including any image content
- You may select MULTIPLE learning objectives if the question covers multiple concepts
- Select objectives that the question is specifically assessing
- Respond with ONLY the numbers separated by commas (e.g., "1,3,5")
- Do NOT include explanations, just the numbers
