Which statement must be true for an object in a gravitational field?
A. Ifthe object has mass then the field causes it to accelerate

B Ifthe object has mass then the field causes it to have weight
C Ifthe object has weight then the field causes it to accelerate
D

If the object has weight then the field causes it to have mass.

A

B
c
D

Energy is never lost but it may be transferred between different forms.
In an inelastic collision, the total energy is constant.
The efficiency of a system is the ratio of the useful energy output to the total energy input.

When a machine does work, friction reduces the total energy

**QUESTION**:


[Image Content]: Which statement about energy is not correct?

A

B
c
D

Energy is never lost but it may be transferred between different forms.
In an inelastic collision, the total energy is constant.
The efficiency of a system is the ratio of the useful energy output to the total energy input.

When a machine does work, friction reduces the total energy

**AVAILABLE LEARNING OBJECTIVES**:
1. [21.1.1] Describe sinusoidal variation of current and voltage
2. [21.1.2] Recall and use rms and peak values relations
