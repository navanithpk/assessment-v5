[Image Content]: Which statement about the uses of metals is correct?

A

Aluminium has a low density and good electrical conductivity which make it suitable for
overhead electrical cables.

Aluminium food containers can only be used for a short time because chemicals in the food
react with the aluminium.

Electrical wiring made from copper is covered with plastic because copper corrodes easily.

Copper is used in the manufacture of aircraft because it has a low density and is not
malleable.

**QUESTION**:


[Image Content]: Which statement about the uses of metals is correct?

A

Aluminium has a low density and good electrical conductivity which make it suitable for
overhead electrical cables.

Aluminium food containers can only be used for a short time because chemicals in the food
react with the aluminium.

Electrical wiring made from copper is covered with plastic because copper corrodes easily.

Copper is used in the manufacture of aircraft because it has a low density and is not
malleable.

[Image Content]: Which statement about alloys is correct?

A
B

Alloys are harder than pure metals because they contain strong intermolecular forces.
Brass is an alloy containing mainly copper and tin

The different-sized atoms in an alloy mean that the layers cannot easily slide over each
other.

There are no alloys containing carbon because carbon is a non-metal

**QUESTION**:


[Image Content]: Which statement about alloys is correct?

A
B

Alloys are harder than pure metals because they contain strong intermolecular forces.
Brass is an alloy containing mainly copper and tin

The different-sized atoms in an alloy mean that the layers cannot easily slide over each
other.

There are no alloys containing carbon because carbon is a non-metal
