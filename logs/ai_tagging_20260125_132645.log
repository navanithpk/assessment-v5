2026-01-25 13:33:21,347 - DEBUG - You are an expert educational content analyzer specializing in IGCSE for Grade Alternating currents.

**TASK**: Analyze the following question and select the MOST relevant learning objective(s) from the provided list.

**CONTEXT**:
- Subject: IGCSE
- Grade: Alternating currents
- Topic: Physics

**QUESTION**:


[Image Content]: When a radioactive isotope is set up close to a counter, a count rate of 38000 counts/s is
obtained. The table shows the count rate from the isotope over a three-year period.

time/years | Sountrate
counts/s

0 38000

1 26000

2 17000

3 12000

What is the half-life of the isotope?

A less than 1 year

Bmore than 1 year but less than 2 years
© more than 2 years but less than 3 years
D

more than 3 years

**AVAILABLE LEARNING OBJECTIVES**:
1. [21.1.1] Describe sinusoidal variation of current and voltage
2. [21.1.2] Recall and use rms and peak values relations

**INSTRUCTIONS**:
- Read the question carefully, including any image content
- You may select MULTIPLE learning objectives if the question covers multiple concepts
- Select objectives that the question is specifically assessing
- Respond with ONLY the numbers separated by commas (e.g., "1,3,5")
- Do NOT include explanations, just the numbers
