[Image Content]: Which statement about the uses of metals is correct?

A

Aluminium has a low density and good electrical conductivity which make it suitable for
overhead electrical cables.

Aluminium food containers can only be used for a short time because chemicals in the food
react with the aluminium.

Electrical wiring made from copper is covered with plastic because copper corrodes easily.

Copper is used in the manufacture of aircraft because it has a low density and is not
malleable.

Propene is a saturated hydrocarbon

Ethene is made by heating long-chain alkanes to a high temperature in the presence
of a catalyst.

Hexene reacts with aqueous bromine, changing its colour from colourless to orange.

Ethene, propene and butene have the same general formula

[Image Content]: Which statements about alkenes are correct?

A

tand3

Propene is a saturated hydrocarbon

Ethene is made by heating long-chain alkanes to a high temperature in the presence
of a catalyst.

Hexene reacts with aqueous bromine, changing its colour from colourless to orange.

Ethene, propene and butene have the same general formula

**TASK**: Analyze the following question and select the MOST relevant learning objective(s) from the provided list.

**CONTEXT**:
- Subject: IGCSE
- Grade: Acid base titrations
- Topic: Chemistry

**QUESTION**:


[Image Content]: Element T has two isotopes, ‘37 and ‘ST.

Which statement about these isotopes is correct?

A
B

They have different chemical properties because they have different numbers of neutrons.

They have the same chemical properties because they have the same number of outer shell
electrons.

They have the same nucleon number because the sum of the number of protons and
electrons is the same.

They have different positions in the Periodic Table because they have different numbers of
neutrons.

**AVAILABLE LEARNING OBJECTIVES**:
1. [12.2.1] Describe titration using burette pipette and indicator
2. [12.2.2] Identify the end point

**INSTRUCTIONS**:
- Read the question carefully, including any image content
- You may select MULTIPLE learning objectives if the question covers multiple concepts
- Select objectives that the question is specifically assessing
- Respond with ONLY the numbers separated by commas (e.g., "1,3,5")

A
B

Alloys are harder than pure metals because they contain strong intermolecular forces.
Brass is an alloy containing mainly copper and tin

The different-sized atoms in an alloy mean that the layers cannot easily slide over each
other.

There are no alloys containing carbon because carbon is a non-metal
